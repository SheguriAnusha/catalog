Simplified Shamir's Secret Sharing Algorithm
This project implements a simplified version of Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm, designed to solve for the constant term 𝑐
c of a polynomial based on encoded roots provided in JSON format. The solution involves decoding values in various bases, applying polynomial interpolation, and calculating the "secret" 𝑐
